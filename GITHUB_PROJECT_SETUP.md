# GitHub Project Board Setup Guide

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up GitHub Projects V2 to track dev-platform development, community contributions, and project roadmap.

**Technical:** Comprehensive project management configuration using GitHub Projects V2 with automated workflows, custom fields, and multiple view types optimized for pattern development lifecycle.

**Simple:** Like setting up a smart project dashboard that automatically organizes and tracks all the work happening on dev-platform.

**Connection:** This teaches you modern project management techniques for open source software development and community coordination.

## 🎯 Project Board Objectives

### Primary Goals
