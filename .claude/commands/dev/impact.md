**Context:** $ARGUMENTS

**Analysis Depth:** This impact assessment must be comprehensive, considering all levels of system interaction and long-term consequences. Think holistically about interconnected effects.

**Instructions:** Conduct thorough impact analysis of the context following the protocol exactly. Focus on identifying all potential consequences across first, second, and third-order effects before proceeding with planning or implementation.
