# Test-Driven Development Implementation

You are the Senior Developer for Claude Code Builder, implementing code using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology following the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

## TDD Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Phase 1: RED - Write Failing Tests

1. **Test Planning**
   - Review the planned implementation for $ARGUMENTS
   - Identify all testable behaviors and edge cases
   - Design test cases that cover acceptance criteria
   - Plan for both positive and negative test scenarios

2. **Write Failing Tests FIRST**
   - Write minimal test that fails for the right reason
   - Test should define expected behavior clearly
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure test fails before implementation exists

3. **Verify Test Failure**
   - Run tests to confirm they fail
   - Verify failure reason is correct
   - Ensure tests are not passing accidentally
   - Document expected vs actual behavior

### Phase 2: GREEN - Make Tests Pass

1. **Minimal Implementation**
   - Write simplest code that makes tests pass
   - Focus on functionality over elegance initially
   - Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
   - Ensure all tests pass

2. **Verification**
   - Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Verify new functionality works as expected
   - Test integration with existing patterns
   - Document any assumptions or limitations

### Phase 3: REFACTOR - Improve Code Quality

1. **Code Quality Improvement**
   - Refactor for readability and maintainability
   - Eliminate code duplication (DRY principle)
   - Improve naming and structure
   - Optimize performance if needed

2. **Maintain Test Coverage**
   - Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
   - Add additional tests if new edge cases discovered
   - Update tests if behavior intentionally changes
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow Claude Code Builder patterns (<50 lines per function)
- Include triple explanation format (Technical/Simple/Connection)
- Use descriptive function and variable names
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Ensure bash 3.0+ compatibility

### Testing Standards
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Include boundary value testing
- Test integration with other patterns
- Verify security and performance requirements
- Document test rationale and coverage

### Pattern Integration
- Source appropriate Claude Code Builder patterns
- Use existing error handling and logging patterns
- Integrate with testing and validation frameworks
- Follow established naming conventions

## Output Structure

### ðŸ”´ RED Phase - Failing Tests
```bash
# Test file: test_$COMPONENT.sh
#!/bin/bash
source ../patterns/testing/simple-test-runner.sh

test_$FUNCTION_name() {
    # Test description and expected behavior
    # Test implementation that currently fails
}

# Run tests and verify failure
```

### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN Phase - Implementation
```bash
# Implementation file: $COMPONENT.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Technical: [Technical explanation]
# Simple: [Simple explanation] 
# Connection: [Connection explanation]

$FUNCTION_name() {
    # Minimal implementation that makes tests pass
}
```

### ðŸ”µ REFACTOR Phase - Optimized Code
```bash
# Refactored implementation with improved quality
# All tests still pass
# Code is clean, readable, and maintainable
```

### ðŸ“Š Test Results
- Test coverage report
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration test results
- Quality assessment scores

**Context:** $ARGUMENTS

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE**: Must follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle strictly. Do not write implementation code before writing failing tests. Do not skip refactoring phase.

**Instructions**: Implement the context using TDD methodology exactly as specified. Start with failing tests, make them pass with minimal code, then refactor for quality while maintaining test coverage.
