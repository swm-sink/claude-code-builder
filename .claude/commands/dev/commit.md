- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Code quality scores meet requirements
- [ ] Security scan completed without critical issues
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed

### Commit Message Structure

#### Standard Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Type Classifications
- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix or issue resolution
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code formatting, no logic changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without behavior change
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Build process, tools, maintenance
- **security**: Security improvements or fixes
- **perf**: Performance improvements

#### Scope Guidelines
- **patterns**: Changes to pattern implementations
- **tools**: Changes to utility tools and scripts
- **tests**: Changes to test suites
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes
- **api**: API changes or additions

### Message Generation Guidelines

- Explain what and why, not how
- Include context and reasoning
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Describe impact and side effects

#### Footer
