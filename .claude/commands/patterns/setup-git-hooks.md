- Preparing intelligent hook installation and validation automation
```

#### Git Hook Types and Configurations

##### Pre-Commit Hooks
```markdown
**üîç Pre-Commit Validation**

Detection: Client-side hook triggered before commit creation
Purpose: Code quality validation, formatting, and conflict detection
Integration: Testing, linting, security scanning, and documentation

Pre-Commit Workflow:
```
Pre-Commit Triggered
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflict Detection     # Merge conflict markers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code Quality          # Linting, formatting, standards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Scanning     # Secret detection, vulnerability scan
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Testing              # Unit tests, quick validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation        # Documentation updates, consistency

```

##### Server-Side Hooks (Pre-Receive/Post-Receive)
```markdown
**üåê Server-Side Validation**

Detection: Server-side hooks triggered on git server/repository host
Purpose: Centralized validation, policy enforcement, and integration
Integration: Team policies, compliance checking, automated workflows

Server-Side Workflow:
```
Server-Side Triggered
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Policy Enforcement   # Team standards, compliance requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Centralized Testing  # Server-side test execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Validation  # Enterprise security policies
