- **Incremental scanning**: Only scan changed files
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple security tools simultaneously
- **Smart file filtering**: Skip binary and irrelevant files

#### Efficient Resource Usage
- **Memory management**: Minimal overhead during scanning
- **Process optimization**: Efficient security tool orchestration
- **Output streaming**: Real-time security findings
- **Selective scanning**: Focus on high-risk areas first

### Security Considerations

#### Safe Security Tool Execution
- **Controlled scanning**: Only approved security tools and patterns
- **Path validation**: Validate all file path inputs for security
- **Output sanitization**: Clean security tool output for safe display
- **Data protection**: Secure handling of detected secrets and vulnerabilities

#### Privacy Protection
- **Secret masking**: Never display full secrets in output
- **Data isolation**: Prevent security data leakage between scans
- **Audit logging**: Secure logging of security scan activities
- **Access control**: Controlled access to security scan results

### Integration Patterns

#### With Quality Gates Pattern
```bash
# Security as part of quality validation
/quality-check "security"     # Quality-focused security checks
/security-scanner "."         # Dedicated comprehensive security scan
# Combined security assessment from both patterns
```

#### With Testing Pattern
```bash
# Security validation before testing
/security-scanner "quick"
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    /error-handler "info" "Security validation passed, proceeding with tests"
    /test-runner "."
else
    /error-handler "error" "Security issues block testing pipeline"
fi
```

#### With Error Handling Pattern
```bash
# Comprehensive security workflow
/error-handler "info" "Starting security validation pipeline"
/security-scanner "."
/error-handler "info" "Security validation completed"
```

### Configuration Options

#### Environment Variables
```bash
SECURITY_STRICT=true          # Strict security enforcement
SECURITY_QUICK_SCAN=false     # Disable quick scan mode
SECURITY_REPORT_FORMAT="detailed"  # Security report format
SECURITY_FAIL_ON_HIGH=true    # Fail on high severity issues
SECURITY_MASK_SECRETS=true    # Mask detected secrets in output
```

#### Project Configuration
```bash
# .securityrc configuration file support

- .security.yml (Universal security config)
```
