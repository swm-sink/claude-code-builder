# 🎯 COMMAND BUILDER MASTER ORCHESTRATOR

Interactive command creation system using research-validated best practices and multi-phase validation.

## Command Builder Framework

### Research Foundation Applied:
- ✅ Multi-prompt variation testing
- ✅ Three-judge validation system
- ✅ Meta-prompt optimization
- ✅ RAG knowledge enhancement
- ✅ Claude Code frontmatter compliance

## Master Orchestration Process

Welcome to the Command Builder! I'll guide you through creating a high-quality Claude Code command using research-backed best practices.

### Building: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase Overview

I'll take you through these phases:

1. **🔬 Research** - Current best practices for your command type
2. **📋 Define** - Command properties and metadata
3. **🎬 Actions** - What your command will do
4. **🧠 Logic** - Implementation with current best practices
5. **🔗 Compose** - Integration with other commands
6. **🎯 Variants** - Multi-prompt testing (5 variations)
7. **⚖️ Judge** - Three-judge evaluation system
8. **🔄 Optimize** - Meta-prompt optimization if needed
9. **📚 Enhance** - RAG knowledge integration
10. **📦 Package** - Final command packaging

### Estimated Time: 15-30 minutes for high-quality command

## Quick Start Options

**Choose your approach:**

a) 🚀 **Quick Build** (10 minutes) - Streamlined process for simple commands
b) 🎯 **Standard Build** (20 minutes) - Full validation with optimization
c) 🏆 **Excellence Build** (30 minutes) - Maximum quality with all enhancements
d) 📋 **Template Build** - Start from existing template

**Your choice (a/b/c/d):** > [WAIT FOR USER INPUT]

### Quick Build Selected:
**Phases:** Research → Define → Actions → Logic → Package
**Validation:** Basic testing only
**Time:** ~10 minutes

### Standard Build Selected:
**Phases:** All phases with validation gates
**Validation:** Multi-prompt + single judge
**Time:** ~20 minutes

### Excellence Build Selected:
**Phases:** All phases with full enhancement
**Validation:** Multi-prompt + three judges + optimization
**Time:** ~30 minutes

### Template Build Selected:
**Available Templates:**
1. **analysis-command** - Commands that analyze code/data
2. **generation-command** - Commands that create/generate content
3. **automation-command** - Commands that automate workflows
4. **utility-command** - General utility commands
5. **integration-command** - Commands that integrate with external systems

**Select template (1-5):** > [WAIT FOR INPUT]

## Command Planning Phase

### Initial Command Assessment:

**Command Name:** $COMMAND_NAME
**Estimated Complexity:** [AUTO-DETECT based on name/args]
- **Simple** (1-2 actions): Straightforward single-purpose command
- **Moderate** (3-5 actions): Multi-step workflow command  
- **Complex** (6+ actions): Advanced logic with conditions/loops
- **Integration** (external): Requires external system integration

**Detected Complexity:** $DETECTED_COMPLEXITY

### Recommended Build Path:
Based on complexity and best practices research:

**For Simple Commands:** Quick Build recommended
**For Moderate Commands:** Standard Build recommended  
**For Complex Commands:** Excellence Build recommended
**For Integration Commands:** Excellence Build required

### Research Phase Prerequisites:

Before we begin building, I need to research current best practices for:
- Command type: $COMMAND_TYPE
- Implementation patterns: $IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS
- Security requirements: $SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS
- Performance standards: $PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS

**Proceed with research phase?** (y/n) > [WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION]

## Research Phase Initiation

**Launching Research Phase...**

I'll now search for current best practices for "$COMMAND_NAME" command implementation.

**Research Query 1:** "$COMMAND_NAME command implementation best practices 2024"
**Research Query 2:** "Claude Code custom commands standards 2024"
**Research Query 3:** "$DETECTED_COMMAND_TYPE security requirements 2024"

[This will trigger WebSearch calls to gather current knowledge]

**Research completed. Continue to command definition phase?** (y/n) > [WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION]

## Phase Progression Control

### Next Phase Selection:

Based on your build mode and current progress:

**Quick Build Next Phase:** Define Properties
**Standard/Excellence Build Next Phase:** Define Properties with Full Validation

**Proceeding to:** `/command-builder/02-frontmatter`

This will create your command with proper Claude Code frontmatter and metadata.

### Build Progress Tracking:
