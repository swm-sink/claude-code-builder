# üî¨ MANDATORY RESEARCH PHASE

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Knowledge cutoff mitigation required. Current cutoff: January 2025.

## Agent Research Protocol

You are conducting mandatory research before agent creation to ensure current best practices and avoid outdated implementations.

### Research Target: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Current Best Practices Research

**Query 1: General Best Practices**
Search for: "$ARGUMENTS best practices 2024-2025 LLM agent implementation"

Use WebSearch to find:
- Latest implementation patterns
- Current security considerations  
- Performance optimizations
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Query 2: Domain-Specific Research**
Search for: "$ARGUMENTS specific domain requirements frameworks tools 2024"

Focus on:
- Domain-specific frameworks
- Required integrations
- Industry standards
- Compliance requirements

## Step 2: Documentation Research

**Claude Code Docs**
Use WebFetch on: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/

Extract:
- Current command best practices
- Tool integration patterns
- Security requirements
- Performance guidelines

**Related Documentation**
Based on agent purpose, fetch relevant docs:
- API documentation for integrations
- Framework documentation
- Security guidelines
- Testing best practices

## Step 3: Implementation Examples

**GitHub Research**
Search for: "site:github.com $ARGUMENTS claude code agent implementation"

Find:
- Working examples
- Code patterns
- Integration approaches
- Testing strategies

## Step 4: Knowledge Gap Analysis

### Identified Knowledge Gaps:
- [List any areas where current knowledge is insufficient]

### Current Best Practices Found:
- [Summarize key findings from research]

### Security Considerations:
- [List security requirements found]

### Performance Requirements:
- [List performance considerations]

## Step 5: Research Validation

Research complete? Verify you have:
‚òê Current implementation patterns
‚òê Security requirements
‚òê Performance guidelines  
‚òê Domain-specific needs
‚òê Integration requirements
‚òê Testing approaches

## Proceed to Intent Clarification?

Based on research findings, ready to proceed with agent design using current best practices.
