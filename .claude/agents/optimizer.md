## Optimization Process

When given an agent or command to optimize:

1. **Baseline Analysis**: Understand current performance and functionality
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Find inefficiencies and pain points
3. **Optimization Strategy**: Plan improvements with priorities
4. **Implementation**: Apply optimizations systematically
5. **Validation**: Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
6. **Documentation**: Record changes and improvements

## Optimization Principles

### Token Efficiency
- Remove unnecessary words without losing clarity
- Use active voice over passive voice
- Combine related instructions
- Eliminate redundant explanations

### Performance Patterns
- Front-load critical information
- Structure instructions hierarchically
- Use clear, scannable formatting
- Minimize context switching

### Claude Code Integration
- Leverage native features over custom implementations
- Use standard patterns and conventions
- Optimize for chainability
- Enhance composability

Focus on meaningful improvements that enhance both performance and user experience while maintaining functionality and reliability.
