# Security Pattern Context

> **Technical background and implementation context for the security pattern**

## Pattern Overview

The security pattern provides comprehensive security scanning with automatic threat detection across multiple programming ecosystems. It serves as the security enforcement foundation for development workflows, ensuring code is protected against common vulnerabilities, credential exposure, and security anti-patterns through intelligent scanning, vulnerability assessment, and actionable remediation guidance.

## Historical Context

### Evolution from Script to Native

**Original Implementation**: `security-basics.sh` (50 lines of bash)
- Basic secret detection (3 pattern types: passwords, API keys, PEM keys)
- Simple environment file checking (.env, config.json)
- Basic private key file discovery
- Minimal security validation reporting

**Native Implementation**: `/security-scanner` command
- Enhanced secret detection with 15+ pattern categories and context-aware matching
- Advanced vulnerability scanning with CVE database integration
- Multi-language security assessment with framework-specific tools
- Comprehensive compliance checking and security best practice validation
- Integration with Claude Code native tools and comprehensive error handling
- Actionable remediation guidance with severity prioritization

### Design Philosophy
**Technical**: Secret detection and basic security scanning with pattern matching for credentials and sensitive data
**Simple**: Security guard that automatically finds passwords, keys, and secrets hiding in your code files
**Connection**: Teaches security automation patterns essential for preventing credential leaks and data breaches

## Technical Implementation

### Security Detection Architecture

#### Multi-Layer Security Detection Strategy
The security scanner employs a comprehensive multi-layer approach to identify security threats:

1. **Static Pattern Analysis**: Advanced regex patterns for secret detection
2. **Vulnerability Database Integration**: Real-time CVE and security advisory checking
3. **Language-Specific Security Tools**: Framework-aware security validation
4. **Configuration Security Assessment**: Secure configuration validation
5. **Dependency Security Analysis**: Third-party package vulnerability scanning

#### Detection Priority Framework
1. **Critical Secrets**: API keys, private keys, database credentials (highest priority)
2. **Known Vulnerabilities**: CVE-listed security issues in dependencies
3. **Security Anti-Patterns**: Code patterns known to cause security issues
4. **Configuration Weaknesses**: Insecure configuration settings
5. **Compliance Violations**: Deviation from security best practices (lowest priority)

### Secret Detection Implementation

#### Advanced Pattern Matching System
```bash
# High-precision secret detection patterns with context awareness
SECRET_PATTERNS=(
    # Credential patterns with context validation
    "password\s*[=:]\s*['\"][^'\"]{6,}['\"]"           # Password assignments
    "api[_-]?key\s*[=:]\s*['\"][^'\"]{10,}['\"]"      # API key assignments  
    "secret[_-]?key\s*[=:]\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}['\"]"    # Secret key assignments
    "access[_-]?token\s*[=:]\s*['\"][^'\"]{10,}['\"]" # Access tokens
    
    # Cloud service specific patterns
    "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}"                                # AWS access keys
    "sk_live_[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}"                         # Stripe live keys
    "xox[baprs]-([0-9a-zA-Z]{10,48})"                 # Slack tokens
    "ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}"                             # GitHub personal tokens
    "AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}"                         # Google API keys
    
    # Cryptographic material patterns
    "-----BEGIN [A-Z ]+-----"                         # PEM format keys
    "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"                     # Private keys
    "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"                 # RSA private keys

    # Database and connection strings
    "mongodb://[^\\s'\"]+:[^\\s'\"]+@"                # MongoDB credentials
    "postgres://[^\\s'\"]+:[^\\s'\"]+@"               # PostgreSQL credentials
