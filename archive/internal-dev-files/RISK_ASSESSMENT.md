## High-Risk Items (Priority 1 - Immediate Attention)

### HR-1: Git Hooks System Failure üö®
**Risk Category:** Technical - Critical Infrastructure  
**Probability:** 3/5 (Medium) | **Impact:** 5/5 (Critical) | **Risk Score:** 15/25

#### Description
Git hooks system breaks during migration, causing complete failure of quality gates, pre-commit checks, and development workflow automation.

#### Root Causes
- Complex hook interdependencies with Level-1-Dev paths
- Pre-commit configuration references broken paths
- Quality gate scripts depend on Level-1-Dev infrastructure
- Git hook installation process disrupted

#### Potential Impact
- **Development workflow halted** - commits/pushes blocked
- **Quality assurance failure** - no pre-commit validation
- **Team productivity loss** - manual quality checking required
- **Code quality degradation** - inconsistent standards
- **Project delivery delay** - development pipeline broken

#### Current Evidence
From breaking changes analysis:
> "All git hooks will stop working when Level-1-Dev is removed"
> "Pre-commit quality checks disabled"
> "Quality gates will be bypassed"

#### Mitigation Strategy
```bash
# Pre-Migration (Risk Prevention)
1. Create standalone git hooks using dev-platform patterns
2. Test hooks extensively in isolated environment
3. Validate hook installation procedures
4. Create hook rollback automation

# During Migration (Risk Monitoring)
1. Install new hooks before removing Level-1-Dev
2. Test each hook individually after installation
3. Validate complete git workflow (commit, push, merge)
4. Keep old hooks backed up and ready for restoration

# Post-Migration (Risk Resolution)
1. Monitor git operations for 48 hours
2. Collect user feedback on hook functionality
3. Fine-tune hook performance and messaging
4. Document any workflow changes
```

#### Contingency Plan
- **Immediate:** Restore backed-up hooks within 10 minutes
- **Short-term:** Temporarily disable problematic hooks
- **Medium-term:** Fix issues and re-enable incrementally
- **Long-term:** Implement improved hook architecture

#### Success Criteria
- All 4 git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, post-commit, prepare-commit-msg) functional
- Hook execution time <5 seconds per hook
- Zero false positives in quality checks
- User workflow unchanged or improved

#### Potential Impact
- **Claude Code assistance degraded** - lost context loading
- **Navigation system broken** - @references fail
- **Development efficiency reduced** - manual documentation lookup
- **Learning system disrupted** - educational context lost
- **Onboarding difficulty** - new developers struggle

#### Current Evidence
From breaking changes analysis:
> "Claude Code navigation will break"
> "@/.claude/level-1-dev/CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Development platform overview"
> "Multiple navigation references will break"

#### Mitigation Strategy
```bash
# Pre-Migration (Risk Prevention)
1. Audit all @references in CLAUDE.md and related files
2. Create dev-platform equivalent navigation structure
3. Test Claude Code functionality with new references
4. Create reference mapping documentation

# During Migration (Risk Monitoring)
1. Update CLAUDE.md references in controlled phases
2. Test @reference functionality after each update
3. Validate Claude Code context loading works
4. Maintain old references until new ones proven

# Post-Migration (Risk Resolution)
1. Test all Claude Code features extensively
2. Update any missed references discovered
3. Optimize navigation structure based on usage
4. Document new context loading patterns
```

#### Contingency Plan
- **Immediate:** Revert CLAUDE.md to pre-migration state
- **Short-term:** Create temporary compatibility references
- **Medium-term:** Gradual migration of references with testing
- **Long-term:** Optimize Claude Code integration architecture

#### Success Criteria
- All @references functional in Claude Code
- Context loading time maintained or improved
- Navigation system fully operational
- No loss of educational/development context
