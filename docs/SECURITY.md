#### Example Report
```
Subject: [SECURITY] Command Injection in quality-check.sh

Description: 
The quality-check.sh pattern executes user-provided input without 
proper validation, allowing command injection.

Location:
File: patterns/quality-gates/quality-check.sh
Line: 45-47

Impact:
High - Arbitrary command execution with user privileges

Reproduction:
1. Create malicious input: echo "; rm -rf /" > malicious.txt

3. Observe command injection

Environment:
- OS: macOS 14.5
- Bash: 3.2.57
- Dev Platform: v1.0.0

Suggested Fix:
Validate input using allowlist approach before execution.

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

#### Input Validation
```bash
# All patterns validate inputs
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    # Check for dangerous characters
    if [[ "$input" =~ [;\|\&\$\`] ]]; then
        log_error "Invalid characters in input"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

#### Path Sanitization
```bash
# All file operations use path validation
validate_path() {
    local path="$1"
    # Prevent path traversal
    if [[ "$path" =~ \.\./|^/ ]]; then
        log_error "Invalid path: $path"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

#### Safe Command Execution
```bash
# Commands use explicit allowlists
safe_execute() {
    local cmd="$1"
    case "$cmd" in
        "npm test"|"pytest"|"go test")
            $cmd
            ;;
        *)
            log_error "Command not allowed: $cmd"
            return 1
            ;;
    esac
}
```

#### Secure Logging
```bash
# Logs sanitize output to prevent information disclosure
log_sanitized() {
    local message="$1"
    # Remove potential secrets
    local clean_msg=$(echo "$message" | sed 's/password=[^[:space:]]*/password=****/g')
    echo "$clean_msg"
}
```
