# Authors and Contributors

## Overview

This document recognizes all contributors to the Dev Platform project and establishes how contributions are tracked and attributed. The Dev Platform is derived from the Level-1-Dev meta-development platform, originally created as part of the AI Podcasts Nobody Knows project.

## üéØ Attribution Philosophy

**Technical:** We maintain comprehensive contributor attribution through DCO-enforced git history, systematic recognition in this file, and transparent governance processes.

**Simple:** Everyone who helps make this project better gets credited and recognized - it's like having your name in the credits of a movie you helped make.

**Connection:** This teaches you how open source communities recognize contributions and build inclusive development environments.
